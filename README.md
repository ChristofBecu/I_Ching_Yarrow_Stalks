# I Ching Yarrow Stalks Method
# Looking at other codes on github I noticed that they all aproached the yarrow stalk method very literally
# i.e. https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/I_Ching/The_Ancient_Yarrow_Stalk_Method
# Imo it could be done much simpler by taking in account the probability of outcome
# and comparing a random float between 0 and 1 with these. 
# Like this the program doesn't need a single loop to yield a line and is so much easier to read.
